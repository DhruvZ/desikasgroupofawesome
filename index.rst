Here you'll find documentation for different software and hardware, as
well as other useful information for interfacing with this research
group.

.. important:: **Before you proceed, please make sure you have read the
               following disclaimers**:

               * The developers cannot guarantee that the code is bug-free,
                 and users should sign up to the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hyperion-announce>`_ to ensure that
                 they are informed as soon as bugs are identified and fixed.
                 The developers cannot be held responsible for incorrect
                 results, regardless of whether these arise from incorrect
                 usage, a bug in the code, or a mistake in the
                 documentation.

               * Users should read the :doc:`important/important` before using
                 Hyperion. In particular, users are fully responsible for
                 ensuring that parameters such as photon numbers and grid
                 resolution are adequate for the problem being studied.
                 Hyperion will *not* raise errors if these inputs are
                 inadequate.
